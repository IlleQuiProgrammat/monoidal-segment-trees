# Monoidal Segment Trees

A short excursion into generalising segment trees for associative range queries with arbitrary functions (along with lazy node and lazy propagation segment trees).

Heavily inspired by [this GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/evincarofautumn/2b5f004ca81e33c62ff0) and [this CodeForces submission](https://codeforces.com/contest/1358/submission/81547890).
